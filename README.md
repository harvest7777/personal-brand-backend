# Getting Started with Supabase

## Prerequisites

You'll need the Supabase CLI installed. If you don't have it yet, follow the [installation guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started).

## Starting Supabase

1. Start the local Supabase instance:

   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

2. The migration files are already in the project at `supabase/migrations/`. They will be automatically applied when you start Supabase.

3. Once started, you'll see connection details for your local Supabase instance including:
   - API URL
   - Database URL
   - Studio URL (for the Supabase dashboard)

That's it! Your local Supabase instance is ready to use.
